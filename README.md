# Distributed_Parallel_Systems_Project

# project overview
Chat Application with Distributed Name and Chat Services
This project was completed as part of a university module on distributed parallel systems. The chat application consists of three modules: NameService, RegisterUser, and ChatService. Each module has a graphical user interface (GUI) and communicates with other modules through sockets. The NameService maps users to four-digit pins, while the RegisterUser module simply registers users in the NameService. Finally, the ChatService allows users to log in with a pin and chat with each other through multicast or direct messages.

## What I Learned 
Throughout the project, I gained practical experience with managing sockets, DatagramPackets, and implementing GUIs in Java. My previous experience working as a Network Administrator also helped me in dealing with the network part of this project.

## conclusion
While the application met the intended learning goals, there were some limitations due to the scope of the project. Nonetheless, I am proud of what I accomplished and the skills I gained through this project.
